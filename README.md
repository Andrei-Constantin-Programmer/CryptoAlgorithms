# CryptoAlgorithms
C++ algorithms for solving various cryptographic cyphers:
1. Caesar Cypher
2. Vigenere Cypher (given key)
3. Vigenere Cypher (no key, given key size)
4. Vigenere Cypher (no key, no key size knowledge)
5. Transposition cypher (plaintext is written row-wise across a certain number of columns; cyphertext is formed by reading out successive columns from left to right)
